# KernelDev
This is a small project of mine where i research about bootloaders and OS-development and share my progress in form of a small (yet badly written) operating system kernel.<br>
Feel free to take a look and download my shitty kernel.

# UPDATE:
I will host a webserver with the compiled i686-binutils binaries soon to avoid headaches.<br>
More informationn will follow soon.
