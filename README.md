# KernelDev
This is a small project of mine where i research about bootloaders and OS-development and share my progress in form of a small (yet badly written) Operatingsystem kernel.
feel free to take a look and download my shitty kernel.

PLEASE NOTE:
The Cross-compiler is currently broken so i'm stuck using vanilla gcc.
If you want to build the binaries you'll need to download and compile the i686-elf-gcc compiler to avoid problems.
